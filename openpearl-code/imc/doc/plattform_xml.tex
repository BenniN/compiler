\chapter{Plattform Specific Names}

\section{Introduction}
Each specific plattform may support a different set of system names.
Thus each target plattform is characterized by a separate xml-file.
These files are created during the build phase of the runtime system
for each target plattform.

\section{Structure of the XML-File}
All possible system elements are located as unordered separate 
elements under the root tag \verb|plattform|.
For the individual types of system elements, the following tags are
provided:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|<signal ...>| defines a system signal
\item \verb|<interrupt ...>| defines a system interupt
\item \verb|<dation ...>| defines a system dation
\item \verb|<configuration ...>| defines a configuration item
\item \verb|<connection ...>| defines a association provider, if 
   non of the above fit
\end{itemize}

These elements have attributes 
\begin{description}
\item [name] is the system name
\item [instances] the number of instances, if specified. If this attribute 
   is not specified, there is no instance limit.
\end{description}

\subsection{Signal-Tag}
The signal tag contains only the attribute \verb|name| for the
system signal name.

\subsection{Interrupt-Tag}
The interrupt tag contains the attribute \verb|name| for the
system interrupt name.
Possible Parameters are listed as subtree \verb|<parameters>|.

\subsection{Dation-Tag}
The dation tag contains the attribute \verb|name| for the
system dation name.
Possible parameters are listed as subtree \verb|<parameters>|.
Possible attributes are listed as subtree \verb|<attributes>|.
Possible associations to this element are
 listed as subtree \verb|<associationProvider>|.


\subsection{Configuration-Tag}
The configuration element has the same structure as the dation tag
except the attribute \verb|name|, which has not to be present.

\subsection{Associations}
The connection between two system elements is treated by the following
elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|<needAssociation>| 
\item \verb|<associationProvider>|  with elements \verb|<associationType>|.
  Attributes for an associationType are:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item  \verb|<name>|,  which is an unique free selectable
     identifier for this kind of  association.
   \item \verb|<clients>|  if given it is the number of allowed
      clients for this connection provider. If not given, there is no
      limits of allowed clients.
   \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
