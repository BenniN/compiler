\section{Devices}

\subsection{Lpc17xxDigitalIn}
The device Lpc17xxDigitalIn provides digital input bits on all
GPIO bits of the LPC1768. It is {\em NOT} checked, whether the 
required bits are in use by other devices.

The LPC1768 provides 5 GPIO ports, numbered from 0 to 4.
Each port has a maximum of 32 bits.
It is stated in the user manual, that a lot of bits are not
available.

Synopsis: \verb|Lpc17xxDigitalIn(port, start, width)|

\begin{description}
\item [port] specifies the port number. Valid numbers are 0,1,2,3,4
\item[start] specifies the number of leftmost bit of the group. Valid numbers
     are 31..0
\item [width] specifies the number of bits which are grouped together.
     Valid numbers are 1..32.
     The group must fit into one port.
\end{description}

The access to the dation is done by reading a BIT(width)-value from the
opened system dation.
Writing other data than BIT-types  may cause a signal, if the size of the
data does not match the required size according the width.

\subsection{Lpc17xxDigitalOut}
The device Lpc17xxDigitalOut provides digital output bits on all
GPIO bits of the LPC1768. It is {\em NOT} checked, whether the 
required bits are in use by other devices.

The LPC1768 provides 5 GPIO ports, numbered from 0 to 4.
Each port has a maximum of 32 bits.
It is stated in the user manual, that a lot of bits are not
available.

Synopsis: \verb|Lpc17xxDigitalOut(port, start, width)|

\begin{description}
\item [port] specifies the port number. Valid numbers are 0,1,2,3,4
\item[start] specifies the number of leftmost bit of the group. Valid numbers
     are 31..0
\item [width] specifies the number of bits which are grouped together.
     Valid numbers are 1..32.
     The group must fit into one port.
\end{description}

The access to the dation is done by writing a BIT(width)-value to the
opened system dation.
Writing other data than BIT-types  may cause a signal, if the size of the
data does not match the required size according the width.

\subsection{Lpc17xxInterrupt}
The devive Lpc17xxInterrupt provides interrupt sources from GPIO inputs.
The LPC1768 can produce interrupts on both edges of the GPIO ports 0 and 2.
The Lpc17xxInterrupt device produces interrupts only on the falling edge. 
Synopsis: \verb|Lpc17xxInterrupt(port, bit)|

\begin{description}
\item [port] specifies the port number. Valid numbers are 0,2
\item[bit] specifies the number of the  bit to monitor.
 Valid numbers are 31..0. 
\end{description}

Note: The LPC1768 does monitor only bits
0-11 and 15-30 on port 0 and 0-13 on port 2.

The landtiger board has Key1 on P2.11 and SW2 an P2.10
the joystick is on P1.25-29
