\brief simple logging system

This module realizes a simple log facility the the PEARL runtime system.
Depending on a statically set log-level, all incoming messages will
be written to a log file, if the current log-level matches the given
log request

Each log-request corresponds with a bit in log-level. If the bit
is set, the message will be formatted and sent to the log file.

The implementation is thread and signal safe. This is achieved by the
usage of open/close/write function. The formatting is provided as
own code, sonce printf() is known to be non signal safe.
If the maximum text width is exceeded the output is truncated
at the maximum position.

The following formats are supported - all without width specification:
<ul>
<li>%d  - signed int
<li>%x  - int
<li>%u  - unsigned int
<li>%s  - char * (c-strings)
<li>%f  - doubles (including specification of the prcision like %.3f)
<li>%c  - single char
</ul>
