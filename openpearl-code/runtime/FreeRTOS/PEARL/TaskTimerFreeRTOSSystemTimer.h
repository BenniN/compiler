   \brief timer facility for task scheduling

   This class provides the timer functions required for task scheduling.

   A timer may be set using the PEARL scheduling parameters.
   A timer my be started. Using the start operation repeatedly will
   restart the timer if it is not expired, or will restart it.
   A timer may be cancelled to disable any further start unless
   it is set again.


   The timer function are mapped to the FreeRTOS timers.
   They may be oneshot or autorepeated. The initial delay is realized by
   a oneshot timer, the repeations are done by a autorepeated timer, which
   is started in the reaction of the oneshottimer.

   AFTER ... ALL  --> oneshot + autorepeated timer

   ALL --> only autorepeated timer
