\begin{description}
\item[Pass 1:]
The tool reads the specified xml files for platform and moduke(s)
 as DOM-trees into memory.
In case of read errors, an error message is emitted and execution aborted.

In case of the usage of direct associations like
\texttt{temp: LM75('48'B4) --- I2CBus('/dev/i2c-1');}
the association providers becomes  replaced by an automatic userName , which
is not avialable by any application program.


\item [Pass 2a: check\_params\_match]
Verify compliance of defined system elements with the platform definitions in
\begin{itemize}
  \item number and type of parameters
\end{itemize}

\item [Pass 2b: check\_associations\_provided]
Verify compliance of defined system elements with the platform definitions in
\begin{itemize}
  \item if requrired: type of accociation provider
\end{itemize}

\item [Pass 2c: check\_username\_sysnames\_mapping] ???

\item [Pass 2d: check\_pin\_layout] check for multiple usage of i/o pins

\item[Pass 3:]
The C++ source code for the sytem part becomes created if no errors were detected.

\end{description}

The process stops after each pass, if there were errors detected.
